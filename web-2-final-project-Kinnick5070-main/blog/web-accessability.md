# Web Accessability

Some of the main points I will go over are 

1. Semantic HTML
2. ARIA Roles and Attributes
3. Text Alternatives

### Semantic HTML

Semantic HTML elements are `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<article>`, `<section>`, and `<footer>`. They are used with assistive technology to better navigate web-pages and help people with dissabilities better navigate your web-page.

### ARIA Roles and Attributes

ARIA stands for Accessabile Rich Internet Applications, and the roles and attributes can work really well with assistive technology to help better explain the layout and purpose of elements.

### Text Alternatives

Text alternatives are really important for visually impared and otherwise dissabled people to better understand the non-text elements, like using the `alt` tag on an `<img>` element.
